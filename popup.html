            A day in Mira

            At five in the morning, the surface of Tuvalu Lagoon was still shrouded in a thin mist. Mira pushed the canoe into the water and skillfully paddled it towards the open sea. Her grandmother once taught her that water could "talk" in the quietest part of the morning. She closed her eyes and listened to the echoes under the OARS and the gentle beats of the water flow - a dialogue with the ocean, and also her daily ritual.
            
            After returning to the shore, she would prepare a simple breakfast by hand: toasted breadfruit with coconut sauce, along with the cold fish soup left from last night. For her, this is not a continuation of tradition, but a reminder - what she represents is not merely the data and legal provisions on the negotiating table, but the taste and memory of her homeland.
            
            In the morning, Mira attended the meeting of the Ocean Council via a holographic terminal. Today's topic is whether to allow a certain country to extend its right of passage on the deep-sea routes in the Pacific Ocean. Her speech was as concise and forceful as ever: "The ocean does not belong to any one country." You must first prove that your ship won't hurt it. The "voice of the ocean" simulated by AI immediately emitted a low sound wave, indicating an increase in water pressure. The venue fell silent for a while.
            
            In the afternoon, she will go to the community center to give lessons to the children. The children, equipped with ocean-sensing devices, transformed the sound waves underwater into melodies. A little girl giggled when she heard this and said, "Teacher, the sea is singing today!" Mira smiled and told them, "Remember, it's not just a song, but also a reminder."
            
            Night fell and the stars rose. Mira sat at her desk, writing down her thoughts of the day by hand instead of relying on the terminal. She wrote down her grandmother's teachings as well as her own hesitation and persistence during the meeting. Having finished writing, she walked out of the house and watched the waves undulate in the moonlight. For her, this is both home and an alliance, as well as a partner who always needs to listen
